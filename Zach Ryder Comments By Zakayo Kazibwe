Introduction
1. Please be sure to include the in-text references for the materials in this introductory paragraph and the rest of your work. 
    In addition, it seems your work is based on only one reference, would you please try to look up some more references to back your arguments?

2. I would rephrase this sentence like, “using the SNPs makes much more sense, given their variability in a population” or something related. 
In your statement, it is not clear what the phrase “this choice” refers to

Discussion
1. Please rerun the analyses and be sure to specify the outgroup. Also, the wolf may not be an appropriate outgroup because it may not be distant enough from the dogs
2. Its good you said you are rerunning the analyses
